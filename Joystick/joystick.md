# The Joystick

Connecting the joystick to your Cortex goes as follows:
* Make sure both devices have their respective batteries. Turn both of them off.
* Connect the two with the orange USB A-A cable (the joystick's port is on the
  bottom, near the batteries)
* Turn just the Cortex on, and wait a little bit. If all goes well, both devices
  should have a green light next to "VEXnet".
* Turn them both off, and unplug the USB cable. Plug the two VEXnet keys that
  were given into each of the devices.
* Turn them both back on, wait, and you should see the same green light as
  before.
* Connect the joystick's PROGRAM port to the computer with the serial to USB
  converter.
* Now you should be able to download programs and see output as if the Cortex
  itself was connected.
