# Mission Possible Programmer's Reference

This repo contains useful information for the Mission Possible project, without
just flat out giving away code. Sorry, you still have to do some thinking.

Something written unclearly, or code not working? Submit an issue, or better
yet, a pull request!

This is also a great resource for example programs: https://github.com/checrobotics/VEX-Sample-Programs
