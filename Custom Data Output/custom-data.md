# Custom Data Output

For my group's extra programming task, I managed to figure out how to send
custom data across the VEXnet connection without any extra parts. This folder
contains RobotC code that sends data to the computer, and example
JavaScript code that reads it. (Of course, you can read and write to a serial
port in just about any language, so don't be confined to just JavaScript if
you're more comfortable in another language.)
